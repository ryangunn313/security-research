# Weeknotes

A structured, technical journal of my security research and bug-bounty learning journey.  
Each entry shows a weekly milestone; linked weeks contain full notes.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1 — Foundations (Weeks 1–12)

- [**Week 1 — Environment setup & first tools**](./2025-09-week1.md)  
  Install WSL2/Kali, essential packages, browser proxy setup, and quick Burp/curl interception checks.

- [**Week 2 — Templates & XSS labs (completed)**](./2025-09-week2.md)  
  Built reusable lab/weekly templates, completed reflected & stored XSS labs, and documented solutions.

- [**Week 3 — Continuing XSS labs (in progress)**](./2025-10-week3.md) *(note: not yet created)*  
  Working through more PortSwigger XSS scenarios, adding screenshots, PoCs, and deep-dive notes.

- Week 2 — Recon basics *(coming soon)*  
  Subdomain discovery, passive vs active recon, amass/subfinder, and initial nmap/masscan sweeps.

- Week 3 — Web fundamentals: HTTP mechanics & tooling *(coming soon)*  
  Deepen knowledge of requests/responses, headers, cookies, sessions, and Burp request manipulation.

- Week 4 — PortSwigger Academy labs (XSS & SQLi intro) *(coming soon)*  
  Guided lab practice for basic XSS and SQLi patterns and safe exploitation workflows.

- Week 5 — Directory brute-forcing & parameter discovery *(coming soon)*  
  Wordlists, ffuf/gobuster usage, and identifying hidden endpoints and parameters.

- Week 6 — Exploitation practice: SQLi & XSS *(coming soon)*  
  Hands-on lab practice, payload crafting, and filtering/encoding handling.

- Week 7 — Authentication, sessions & token handling *(coming soon)*  
  Testing auth flows, session fixation, JWT inspection, and common token pitfalls.

- Week 8 — Access control: IDOR & CSRF testing *(coming soon)*  
  Authorization checks, object-level access testing, and CSRF attack simulation.

- Week 9 — Bug-bounty workflow & triage *(coming soon)*  
  Scoping, reproducible PoC patterns, prioritization, and sanitized reporting templates.

- Week 10 — Automation & scanning pipelines *(coming soon)*  
  Nuclei templates, CI-style scanning, and helper scripts for triage/automation.

- Week 11 — End-to-end practice on safe targets *(coming soon)*  
  Full recon → exploit → report cycle against practice targets and CTF-style labs.

- Week 12 — Reflection & next-phase planning *(coming soon)*  
  Summarize key lessons, refine methodology, and plan follow-up learning tracks.

### Future Phases

After the first 12 weeks, this path will expand into:

- **Advanced exploitation**  
  SSRF, XXE, file upload bypasses, deserialization, logic flaws, and race conditions.

- **API security**  
  Broken object-level authorization (BOLA), JWT attacks, rate limiting, and fuzzing APIs.

- **Bug bounty workflow**  
  Target selection, safe reporting, triage methodology, and participating in live events.

- **Automation**  
  Custom nuclei templates, recon scripting in Python/Go, and automated scanning pipelines.

- **Specialization**  
  Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure misconfigs), mobile app security, reverse engineering, or binary exploitation.
